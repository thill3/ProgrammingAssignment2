## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
#makeCacheMatrix creates an object that stores a matrix and sets up methods for 
        #dealing with parts of that matrix.
        #set changes the matrix
        #get retrieves the matrix
        #setInverse computes the inverse of a new matrix
        #getInverse retrieves the inverse
#cacheSolve will find the inverse of that matrix, but it will only do the 
        #computation if the matrix has changed. Otherwise it retrieves the 
        #stored value

## I tend to comment my code heavily. Helps me keep track of what's going on.
